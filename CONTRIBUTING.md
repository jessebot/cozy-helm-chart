# Contributing
To contribute, please make sure to install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) hooks in the root of the repo by running the following after cloning the repo and changing to the repo dir:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Then you just need to make sure to bump the version in [Chart.yaml](./charts/cozy-stack/Chart.yaml) according to [semver](https://semver.org/#summary).
